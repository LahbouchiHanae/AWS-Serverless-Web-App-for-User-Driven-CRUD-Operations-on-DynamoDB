# Serverless Web Application on AWS

This project demonstrates the development of a **serverless web application** for managing products, leveraging the power of AWS cloud services. The application provides a seamless user experience to perform CRUD (**Create, Read, Update, Delete**) operations on a **DynamoDB** table designed to store product data. This solution ensures scalability, efficiency, and minimal operational overhead ideal for modern cloud-based applications.

  - Lambda : for running serverless functions to handle business logic
  - DynamoDB : for storing and managing data
  - API Gateway : for exposing RESTful APIs to the front-end
  - CloudFront : for content delivery and performance optimization
  - Route 53 : for domain management and DNS routing
- Front-End Technologies:
  - HTML : for structuring the web pages
  - CSS : for styling and creating a responsive design
  - JavaScript : for handling user interactions and API requests



## Key Achievements:
